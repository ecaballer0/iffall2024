    <li>Elena Caballero, CommDes, Junior</li>
    <li>I work primarily as an illustrator and designer but I really enjoy the studio arts as well and work in the theatre arts. 
        I am taking this class as part of my major but I am excited to learn more!</li>
    <li>I have some experience with HTML and CSS from highschool and a few assignments, but not very much.</li> 
    <li>I'm most excited to learn more techniques on CSS and be able to really apply my design skills to my projects.</li>
    <li>Designing for the screen has the extra variable of designing for multiple screen sizes, not just one print size.</li>
    <li>One site I think has really effective design is <a href="https://djr.com/">djr.com</a>. 
        I think it works really well to display the artist's work and the large displays allow the viewer to really see the type 
        in action in multiple sizes.</li>
    <li> I think the communication from <a href= "https://www.npr.org/"> npr.org</a> is really effective as it allows the user to 
        access articles and radio just from the home page. Many of the articles also include their own audio as well.</li>
    <li> I really like the functions of <a href= "https://public.work/"> public.works</a> because they allow viewing of the images
         without any hinderance from text and all the images are public domain. </li>
