<h1>Low-fi Recipe Prototypes</h1>
<h2> Options 1 & 2</h2>
<img src="images/IMG_0016.JPG" alt="options 1 & 2"> 
<p>These options take a simpler route putting list order and images at a higher priority</p>
<h2> Option 3</h2>
<img src="images/IMG_0017.JPG" alt="option 3"> 
<p>Option 3 was created to allowed the viewer to scroll through a gallery of images and get a good idea of what the 
    final result would look like. I also put the list order at higher priority to ease finding the number on the page when scrolling through steps.
