    <h2>Lemon Cake</h2>
        <p>
            This lemon cake recipe comes from my aunt who used to make it for me when I would come over for the holidays. 
            It yields a really moist cake with a strong lemon flavor and doesn't take that long to put together since it's not technically from scratch.
            Some of the ingredients seem unconventional but they are actually super helpful for putting together a moist and flavorful cake.

    <h2>Recipe websites</h2>
        <li><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">NYT Cooking</a> is a great website for finding quality recipes. It separates recipes out by occaision, region, 
            diet, cook time, and even ingrdients. It's a super helpful resource but it almost feels like there's too much information and the options can be overwhelming. 
            They do also have incredible food images which are a great resource.</li>
            <br>
        <li><a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/">Bon Apetit</a> is another very well known recipe site. I really like how they have restaurant reviews and 
            technique articles alonside their recipes. The added information feels like you're getting more from a subscription and gives you more of a connection to 
            overall food culture.</li>
            <br>
        <li><a href="https://preppykitchen.com/">Preppy Kitchen</a> is a smaller website following more of the blog-style that is well associated with recipe sites. 
            I love the approach of emphasizing seasonal recipes as it gives the viewer a sense of what is best to cook to have the freshest produce possible. I also 
            really enjoy how it connects the viewer with the writer since it is just run by one person.</li>
           
    <h2>Other Sites</h2>
        <li><a href="https://www.mattarmendariz.com/">Matt Armendariz</a> is a food photographer and I really love the quality of his images and his aesthetic approach
            to showing food. His color palette is one that really speaks to me as having punchy colors without being oversaturated. I also really love how simple his 
            website functions with dropdown menus and clear distinctions between types of product.</li>
            <br>
        <li><a href="https://eatfishwife.com/?gad_source=1">Fishwife</a> is a tinned fish company with a really strong approach to branding. I love their vibrant colors 
            and their consistent approaches to illustration. I especially love how they incorporate recipes and merchandise into their site, creating a whole brand identity 
            while primarily only selling fish.</li>
            <br>
        <li><a href="https://httpster.net/">Httpster</a> is a we design website focused on displaying new and different websites. I really enjoy the time based scroll on the 
                side that sorts out their posts by month. I think on a large scale restaurant website this could be a cool feature that sythesizes recipes with cooking seasonally.</li>
